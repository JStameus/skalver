# Skalver

Skalver is a personal development visualization app that aims to give users a visual overview of things they've learned along with some handy tools for organizing notes. 

The idea is to provide a visual aid for people who struggle with organization, concentration and memory by making organizing notes and newfound knowledge more interactive and stimulating. While a well organized notebook is well and good for some people, others, such as myself, may find it easier to be able to clearly see personal progress laid out on a "map" of sorts, making it easy to retrace their steps, see visual connections between related notes, and highlight relevant parts of the map connected to certain topics.

The app is currently being built for web browsers using JavaScript and three.js, but if possible, I want to make it available on mobile devices as well.
